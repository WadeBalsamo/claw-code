Claw Code Local
Claude Code experience. Local models. Zero API costs.

Run a full-featured coding agent CLI against Ollama, LM Studio, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — entirely on your machine, with your own models.

Built on top of claw-code-parity, a clean-room Rust reimplementation of the Claude Code harness.

What this is
Claw Code Local patches the claw CLI to use any LLM provider, not just Anthropic. The upstream project built a full multi-provider API layer but never wired it into the actual binary — it was hardcoded to require Anthropic credentials. We fixed that, along with a streaming render bug that caused terminal output to smash sections together.

What you get:

Interactive REPL with session persistence, slash commands, markdown rendering
Tool use: file read/write/edit, grep, glob, bash execution, git integration
/commit, /diff, /pr, /review, /mcp, /agents, /skills and 130+ slash commands
Works with any model your hardware can run
Sessions auto-save and can be resumed
Quickstart
Prerequisites
Rust toolchain (1.70+)
Ollama running locally (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
A model pulled in Ollama (e.g. ollama pull qwen3:14b)
Build
git clone https://github.com/codetwentyfive/claw-code-local.git
cd claw-code-local/rust
cargo build -p rusty-claude-cli --release
The binary is at rust/target/release/claw.exe (Windows) or rust/target/release/claw (Linux/macOS).

Configure
Set two environment variables. The API key value doesn't matter for Ollama — it just needs to be non-empty.

Bash / Zsh:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
PowerShell (add to $PROFILE):

$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "ollama"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
Optionally add the binary to your PATH for global access.

Run
# Interactive REPL
claw --model qwen3:14b

# One-shot prompt
claw --model qwen3:14b "explain this codebase"

# Switch models mid-session with /model
/model qwen3.5-35b-uncensored:iq3m

# Resume your last session
claw --resume latest
Supported providers
The CLI auto-detects the provider from the model name and environment variables:

Provider	Models	Env vars
Ollama	Any model you've pulled	OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LM Studio	Any loaded model	OPENAI_API_KEY=lmstudio OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
OpenAI	gpt-4o, o1, etc.	OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
xAI (Grok)	grok-3, grok-3-mini	XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
Anthropic	claude-opus, sonnet, haiku	ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
Any OpenAI-compatible	Depends on provider	OPENAI_API_KEY=... OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://...
What we changed from upstream
Two patches, both original:

Multi-provider CLI wiring — The api crate already had ProviderClient with OpenAI-compat and xAI support, but the CLI hardcoded AnthropicClient and always required Anthropic credentials. We swapped it to ProviderClient::from_model_with_anthropic_auth() so the provider is auto-detected from the model name and env vars.

Streaming markdown render fix — render_markdown() called trim_end() which stripped trailing newlines. In streaming mode each chunk is rendered independently, so block separators (between tables, headings, paragraphs) got eaten and everything ran together on one line. Added a streaming-safe render path that preserves block spacing.

Upstream
This is a fork of ultraworkers/claw-code-parity, which is itself a clean-room Rust reimplementation of Claude Code's agent harness — not a copy of Anthropic's source code. See the upstream README and PARITY.md for the full porting status.
